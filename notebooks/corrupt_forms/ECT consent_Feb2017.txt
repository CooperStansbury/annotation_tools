Date: Patient Name (Print)
1) I, the undersigned, understand the potential benefits as well as the potential risks involved in treatment of my diagnosis of
 by means of ECT. I acknowledge that Dr.  has explained the purpose of the procedure, the risks/benefits of the procedure, the alternatives with the risks and benefits and the possibility of complications.
I hereby give my consent and authorize and request the staff of the Johns Hopkins Hospital to give a series of ECT treatments to me. My doctor intends to begin the treatment course with one of the following (check one):  Unilateral treatments: Specify right  or left   Bilateral treatments  The lead placement may be altered during the treatment series based on the clinical response
2) The indications of ECT have been explained to me in a manner that I understand. These include psychiatric disorders such as major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, catatonia and other conditions as explained by the provider.
3) The benefits and likelihood of success of ECT have been explained to me in a manner that I understand. These include improvement of mood and psychiatric condition. ECT has been shown to be a highly effective treatment.
4) The major risks and complications of ECT have been explained to me in a manner that I understand. These may include such items as failure to obtain the desired result, discomfort, injury, need for additional treatment(s) and death.
Additional risks include:

Some patients have difficulty forming new memories while getting ECT which, once ECT is stopped, should resolve


Memory difficulty for the period surrounding the treatment is to be expected


All patients experience some degree of permanent loss of memories around the time of treatment, although many of those lost memories may return


A small percentage (1/200) of patients report severe problems in memory that persist


Although rare, there is a very small chance that some of the procedure may be recalled after the treatment


Myocardial infarct (heart attack) or stroke are rare


Dislocations or bone fractures are extremely rare


Risk of damage to fragile teeth


5) The reasonable alternatives, including major risks, benefits, and/or side effects, have been explained to me in a manner I understand. These include:
Alternatives (choose all applicable): Major Risks, Benefits, and Side Effects of Each Alternative:
 Not undergo procedure listed above Possible progression of disease, no improvements in symptoms or condition, possible death. Benefits include not incurring risks associated with the above.
 Medication A non-invasive method that may not effectively treat the psychiatric condition with possible 6-8 weeks to achieve the desired outcome and with potential side effects such as orthostatic hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Benefits include not incurring risks associated with the procedure.
A non-invasive method which is most effective when paired with medication over time and may not  Psychotherapy effectively treat the severe psychiatric condition. Benefits include not incurring risks associated with the procedure.
6) During the procedure, the provider may become aware of conditions which were not apparent before the start of the procedure. I consent to additional or different operations or procedures the provider considers necessary or appropriate to diagnose, treat, or cure such conditions.
7) Due to the risk of confusion and memory loss, it is important to avoid driving and making important personal or business decisions during the ECT course. After the acute treatment course, there will be a convalescence period of approximately 1 to 3 weeks. During this period, it is important to continue refraining from these activities until advised otherwise by the treating physician.
