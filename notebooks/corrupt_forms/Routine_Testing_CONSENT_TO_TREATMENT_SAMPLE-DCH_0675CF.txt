HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) ANTIGEN AND/OR ANTIBODY TEST



I have been informed that my blood obtained from a finger stick or vein, a plasma sample, a urine sample,
or an oral sample from my mouth, will be tested for antigens and/or antibodies to the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus, the virus that causes AIDS.



I acknowledge that I have been given an explanation of the test, including its uses, benefits, limitations
and the meaning of test results.



I have been informed that the HIV test results are confidential and shall not be released without my
written permission, except to: _____________________________* and as permitted under state law.



I understand that I have a right to have this test done without the use of my name. If my private physician
does not provide anonymous testing, I understand that I may obtain anonymous testing at any Michigan
Department Health and Human Services-approved HIV counseling and testing site. 



I understand that I have the right to withdraw my consent for the test at any time before the test is
complete.

antibodies, and I acknowledge that my questions have been answered to my satisfaction.
