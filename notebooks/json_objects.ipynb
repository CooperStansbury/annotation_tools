      "DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: I understand that blood or blood products will be introduced into one of my veins. \n",
      "My doctor will determine the amount of blood or blood products to be transfused based on my particular needs. \n",
      "RISKS: It has been explained to me that the transfusion of blood and/or blood products is ordinarily a very safe, \n",
      "effective, low-risk procedure. I understand the risks may include, but are not limited to: \n",
      "A. MINOR AND TEMPORARY REACTIONS: These are not uncommon, and may include a slight bruise, swelling or local infection in the area where the needle pierces the skin. Minor reactions to the transfusion may include, but are not limited to: headache, chills, fever, mild skin reaction such as itching, rash or hives. \n",
      "B. SERIOUS REACTIONS: These are possible, but very unlikely. Such serious reactions may include, but are not limited to: transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis, AIDS, cytomegalovirus (CMV), or bacterial infection. Other serious reactions may include fluid overload, lung failure, or death. Transfusion of the wrong type of blood very rarely occurs but when it does, it can be fatal. \n",
      "AUTOLOGOUS AND DONOR DIRECTED: These risks also pertain to the following: \n",
      "A. Autologous transfusion (prearrangement for the donation of my own blood which is stored and transfused back to me under the direction of my doctor). \n",
      "B. Directed donor (prearrangement for the donation of blood by compatible family members or friends which is stored and transfused back to me under the direction of my doctor). \n",
      "ALTERNATIVES: The alternative methods to transfusion and the option of refusing have been explained to me. understand that it may be impossible for me to use one of these alternative methods. However, I have been told that if I do not have enough blood or critical blood components, I may go into shock or a coma and/or suffer very serious harm or even death. In these situations, I understand there is NO EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO BLOOD TRANSFUSION. Before 1-sign this form, I know I can talk to my doctor to have my questions answered. \n",

I have been given the chance to refuse the transfusion(s). \n",
