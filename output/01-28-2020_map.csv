Donor sperm may also be used with in vitro fertilization where eggs will be inseminated in a dish with donor sperm or with ICSI (intracellular sperm injection) and some of the resulting embryos will be transferred to your womb.,544,23099502,,,,,,
"Prior to using donor sperm, you will undergo screening that includes psychological counseling, a cavity evaluation, medical history and physical examination, ultrasound, and blood tests.",773,23099502,,,,,,
"If the results of all of the screening tests are acceptable, you will be able to pursue treatment with donor sperm.",961,23099502,,,,,,
"In addition to this Donor Sperm Consent form, you will be required to review the informed consent forms for the specific procedure for which you are using the donor sperm.",1082,23099502,,,,,,
Special Considerations,1255,23099502,,,,,,
"Until the 1980s, donor insemination was usually performed using fresh semen.",1280,23099502,,,,,,
"Today, because of concerns of possible transmission of infectious diseases like HIV, donor insemination is performed using frozen donor sperm.",1357,23099502,,,,,,
These specimens are quarantined for at least 6 months before the specimens can be used.,1500,23099502,,,,,,
The 6-month quarantine allows time for careful screening of the donor.,1588,23099502,,,,,,
The long term psychological risks to a woman using sperm from an anonymous donor are thought to be minimal.,1663,23099502,,,,,,
"Although the donor does not know who receives the sperm, and you do not know the identity of the donor, today technology exists that allows for you to trace the identity of the donor and for the donor to trace the identity of their offspring using DNA.",1772,23099502,,,,,,
"You have decided to use donor sperm after being informed of other available therapies for infertility, and including adoption.",2026,23099502,,,,,,
You understand that there is no guarantee that pregnancy will occur.,2155,23099502,,,,,,
"If pregnancy results, there is no guarantee that it will proceed to term.",2225,23099502,,,,,,
"Donor Screening 
You will be notified of relevant portions of the donor s medical record.",2300,23099502,,,,,,
This is important for your decision in choosing a donor and may also be important to the medical treatment of any child born as a result of the donation.,2391,23099502,,,,,,
Most of the information in the donor ,2546,23099502,,,,,,
s,2583,23099502,,,,,,
"medical record is obtained by questioning of the donor, rather than by performing diagnostic tests, and the validity of the 
 
information may not be independently confirmed.",2585,23099502,,,,,,
Donors are screened for infectious diseases.,2762,23099502,,,,,,
Some Donors will have DNA testing completed.,2807,23099502,,,,,,
"If you choose a donor that positive results for genetic traits, please discuss these results with your provider BEFORE the insemination process.",2853,23099502,,,,,,
Most patients obtain donor sperm from commercial Sperm Banks.,2999,23099502,,,,,,
After you have completed your selection you will need to purchase the samples directly from the sperm bank and arrange to have them shipped to Strong Fertility Center.,3062,23099502,,,,,,
"Recipient Screening 
You will need to have a consultation with an approved psychological counselor to discuss issues specific to the use of donor sperm.",3233,23099502,,,,,,
"The purpose of the counselor visit is to screen for issues that may arise during the therapy, both successful and otherwise.",3387,23099502,,,,,,
An important part of the process is the protection of offspring which may result from the therapy.,3513,23099502,,,,,,
The recipient agrees that in rare instance the evaluation from the counselor results in not recommending treatment.,3613,23099502,,,,,,
"The physician team is not held liable for the acceptance of the recommendation, which again, is felt to be in the best interest of a child.",3730,23099502,,,,,,
You will need to have testing prior to initiating treatment with donor sperm in order to ensure your safety during the treatment and anticipated pregnancy.,3871,23099502,,,,,,
Some of these tests will look for infections that could endanger a pregnancy.,4028,23099502,,,,,,
"You will be tested for sexually transmitted diseases, hepatitis, and HIV (the virus that causes AIDS).",4107,23099502,,,,,,
"If evidence of any type of infection is found, the results will be discussed with you and, if needed, you will be referred for treatment.",4211,23099502,,,,,,
"In addition to infectious disease screening, other tests may be required that would be recommended for any woman anticipating pregnancy or infertility treatments.",4350,23099502,,,,,,
"These tests include blood typing and Rh status, and rubella titer.",4516,23099502,,,,,,
We require all of these screening procedures before your first cycle of treatment.,4584,23099502,,,,,,
"For subsequent cycles, you may need to repeat a few of these tests.",4668,23099502,,,,,,
If more than a year has gone by since your first cycle we may require you to repeat your screening tests.,4737,23099502,,,,,,
Confidentiality,4845,23099502,,,,,,

adverse outcome.",6053,23099502,,,,,,
It is the policy of Strong Fertility Center to inform the sperm bank if a pregnancy results from the donation.,6331,23099502,,,,,,
"It is understood that the legal status of the donor is somewhat uncertain and that the laws may change, especially with respect to anonymity.",6443,23099502,,,,,,

Strong Fertility Center reserves the right to change its charges and fees.,7352,23099502,,,,,,
Consults with other health professionals,7430,23099502,,,,,,
We require each person that plans to use donor sperm for artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization to have a visit with a psychological counselor.,7472,23099502,,,,,,
"Our staff will provide names of counselors who are familiar with ASRM guidelines regarding use of donor sperm, eggs or embryos, and have agreed to see persons considering Donor Insemination.",7627,23099502,,,,,,
We view this counseling as an opportunity to prepare you for the stresses of your treatment.,7818,23099502,,,,,,
Individuals who are identified by the counselor as needing further support may choose to have continued counseling.,7911,23099502,,,,,,
"In addition, the counselor will discuss issues specific to receiving donor sperm including what and when to tell a child about how they were conceived.",8028,23099502,,,,,,
These issues are worth thinking about before beginning treatment with donor sperm.,8181,23099502,,,,,,
We may ask some individuals anticipating the use of donor sperm to have genetic screening.,8265,23099502,,,,,,
The particular genetic screening may differ from woman to woman.,8356,23099502,,,,,,
"If you do need genetic screening, we will offer to refer you to a genetic counselor that will advise you of the risks and benefits of screening.",8421,23099502,,,,,,
Pregnancy itself can be a health risk.,8567,23099502,,,,,,
"If you are over the age of 45 or have any significant illness (such as asthma, diabetes, or multiple sclerosis), we will ask you to be cleared by your internist and/or a board-certified perinatologist before starting your treatment.",8606,23099502,,,,,,
All women over the age of 45 will require a cardiac evaluation.,8840,23099502,,,,,,
"If you have a history of any other significant illness, you will need a consultation with another relevant specialist before starting your treatment.",8906,23099502,,,,,,
Procedures,9057,23099502,,,,,,
The procedures for intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization are discussed in their respective informed consent forms.,9069,23099502,,,,,,
Additional consent forms may need to be understood and signed.,9199,23099502,,,,,,
Risks,9265,23099502,,,,,,
"The use of donor sperm carries with it the risk of sexually transmitted diseases including but not limited to gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, hepatitis, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).",9276,23099502,,,,,,
The risk for infectious disease with the use of donor sperm is extremely small as the sperm donors are tested prior to giving the sperm specimens and again after the sperm has been frozen and quarantined for 6 months.,9475,23099502,,,,,,
This allows for retesting for HIV and other infectious diseases before releasing the samples for use.,9694,23099502,,,,,,
Failure to Achieve Pregnancy,9797,23099502,,,,,,
Your chance of achieving pregnancy with donor sperm is dependent upon whether you are undergoing unstimulated or stimulated insemination or in vitro fertilization and upon your age and infertility diagnosis.,9827,23099502,,,,,,
The most common reason for needing donor insemination is a couple with absence of functional sperm.,10036,23099502,,,,,,
In most cases there is no reason to believe that the women herself has a fertility problem.,10136,23099502,,,,,,
"Because of this, it may not be necessary for you to undergo complete fertility testing before starting your cycle of treatment.",10229,23099502,,,,,,
"For women under age 35, about 15 to 20% of women will become pregnant in each cycle of treatment.",10358,23099502,,,,,,
We anticipate that half will achieve pregnancy within four cycles of donor insemination.,10457,23099502,,,,,,
The chance of pregnancy in these cases may depend on the quality of the frozen sperm.,10546,23099502,,,,,,
"If you have undergone more than four cycles of insemination and have not yet conceived, you should make an appointment with your physician to discuss the possibility that you may have other conditions that are preventing a pregnancy.",10633,23099502,,,,,,
"For example, if you have not had a test to make sure your fallopian tubes are open, your physician may recommend such a test at that time.",10867,23099502,,,,,,
The chance of conception is dependent on the number of ovarian follicles that a woman produces.,11007,23099502,,,,,,
Medications can be used to increase the number of eggs that you produce (ovulate) in a cycle.,11104,23099502,,,,,,
More eggs will lead a greater chance of pregnancy.,11198,23099502,,,,,,
It can also increase the chances that you will have a multiple pregnancy.,11249,23099502,,,,,,
Pregnancy Risks,11325,23099502,,,,,,
"As with any pregnancy, a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, multiple births, congenital abnormalities (birth defects) and/or genetic abnormalities may occur.",11342,23099502,,,,,,
"Within the normal human populations a certain percentage (approximately 4%) of children are born with physical or mental defects, and that the occurrence of such defects is beyond the control of physicians.",11510,23099502,,,,,,
"Within the normal population, approximately 20% of pregnancies result in miscarriages in woman under age 35; this may occur after the use of donor sperm as well.",11720,23099502,,,,,,

General Information About Genetic Testing",43,94407046,,,['B'],I understand that my health care provider has ordered the following genetic testing for {me/my child}:___________________________.,,
What is genetic testing ,218,94407046,,,,,,
Genetic disorders are caused by changes in a person s DNA.,243,94407046,,,,,,
DNA is the material that provides instructions for our body s growth and development.,302,94407046,,,,,,
"For example, DNA determines such things as eye color and how our lungs work.",388,94407046,,,,,,
"DNA is compacted into 46 chromosomes, which are found in almost every cell of the body.",465,94407046,,,,,,
A gene is a stretch of DNA on a chromosome that has the instructions for making a protein.,554,94407046,,,,,,
Genetic testing is a type of medical test that identifies changes in chromosomes and the DNA of a gene.,652,94407046,,,,,,
"The purpose of this test is to see if I, or my child, have a genetic variant or chromosome rearrangement causing a genetic disorder or to determine the chance I, or my child, will develop or pass on a genetic disorder in the future.",757,94407046,,,,,,
"For the purposes of this Consent, my child can also mean my unborn child.",990,94407046,,,,,,
"Additional information about the specific test being ordered is available from my health care provider or I can go to the GeneDx website, www.genedx.com.",1066,94407046,,,,,,
"This information includes the specific types of genetic disorders that can be identified by the genetic test, the likelihood of a positive result, and the limitations of genetic testing.",1221,94407046,,,,,,
What could I learn from this genetic test ,1408,94407046,,,,,,
"If {I/my child} have a family history of one of the conditions that is being tested, I should inform the laboratory of the specific gene variant(s) or chromosome rearrangement present in the family if it is known.",1452,94407046,,,,,,
"The genetic test may identify the cause of the genetic disease that {I/my child} have or a normal genetic result may significantly reduce, but cannot eliminate, the likelihood that the condition in {me/my child} is genetic or that {I/my child} will develop the genetic disorder in the future.",1667,94407046,,,,,,
"The following describes the possible results from the test:
1)",1961,94407046,,,,,,
Positive:,2024,94407046,,,,,,
A positive result indicates that a gene or chromosome vari ation has been identified that explains the cause of {my/my child s} genetic disorder or that {I/my child} am at increased risk to develop the disorder in the future.,2035,94407046,,,,,,
It is possible to test positive for more than one genetic variant.,2261,94407046,,,,,,
2) Negative:,2328,94407046,,,,,,
A negative result indicates that no disease-causing genetic variant was identified for the test performed.,2342,94407046,,,,,,
"It does not guarantee that 
{I/my child} will be healthy or free from other genetic disorders or medical conditions.",2449,94407046,,,,,,
"If {I/my child} test negative for a variant known to be present in other members of {my/my child s family}, this result rules out a diagnosis of the same genetic disorder in {me/my child}. 
3)",2566,94407046,,,,,,
Inconclusive/Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS):,2760,94407046,,,,,,
"A finding of a variant of uncertain significance indicates that a change in a gene was detected, but it is currently unknown whether that change is associated with a genetic disorder.",2815,94407046,,,,,,
A variant of uncertain significance is not the same as a positive result and does not clarify whether {I/my child} am at increased risk to develop a genetic disorder.,3000,94407046,,,,,,
The change could be a normal genetic variant or it could be disease-causing.,3168,94407046,,,,,,
"Further analysis may be recommended, including testing both parents and other family members.",3245,94407046,,,,,,
Detailed medical records or information from other family members also may be needed to help clarify results.,3339,94407046,,,,,,
"4) Unexpected results: In rare instances, this test may reveal an import ant genetic change that is not directly related to the reason for ordering this test.",3450,94407046,,,,,,
"For example, this test may tell me about the risk for another genetic condition {I/my child} am not aware of or it may indicate differenc es in the number or rearrangement of sex chromosomes.",3609,94407046,,,,,,
This information may be disclosed to the ordering health care provider if it likely impacts medical care.,3802,94407046,,,,,,
"Result interpretation is based on currently available information in the medical literature, research and scientific databases.",3908,94407046,,,,,,
"Because the literature, medical and scientific knowledge are constantly changing, new information 
that becomes available in the future may replace or add to the information",4036,94407046,,,,,,
GeneDx used to interpret {my/my child s} results.,4211,94407046,,,,,,
"GeneDx does not routinely re-analyze test results or issue new test reports, and has no obligation to do so.",4261,94407046,,,,,,
"I, or {my/my child s} health care providers may monitor publicly available resources used by the medical community, such as 
ClinVar (www.clinvar.com), to find current information about the clinical interpretation of my/my child s",4370,94407046,,,,,,

What are the risks and limitations of this genetic test ,4614,94407046,,,,,,
 ,4671,94407046,,,,,,
Genetic testing is an important part of the diagnostic process.,4673,94407046,,,,,,
"However, genetic tests may not always give a definitive answer.",4737,94407046,,,,,,
 ,4803,94407046,,,,,,
"In some cases, testing may not identify a genetic variant even 
though one exists.",4805,94407046,,,,,,
"This may be due to limitations in current medical 
knowledge or testing technology.",4889,94407046,,,,,,
 ,4973,94407046,,,,,,
"Accurate interpretation of test results may require knowing the true 
biological relationships in a family.",4975,94407046,,,,,,
"Failing to accurately state the biological relationships in {my/my child s} family may result in incorrect interpretation of results, incorrect diagnoses, and/or inconclusive test results.",5083,94407046,,,,,,
 ,5272,94407046,,,,,,
"In some cases, genetic testing can reveal that the true biological 
relationships in a family are not as they were reported.",5274,94407046,,,,,,
This includes non-paternity (the stated father of an individual is not the biological father) and consanguinity (the parents of an individual are related by blood).,5400,94407046,,,,,,
It may be necessary to report these findings to the health care provider who ordered the test.,5565,94407046,,,,,,
 ,5660,94407046,,,,,,
Genetic testing is highly accurate.,5662,94407046,,,,,,
"Rarely, inaccurate results may occur for various reasons.",5698,94407046,,,,,,
"These reasons include, but are not limited to: mislabeled samples, inaccurate reporting of clinical/medical information, rare technical errors, or unusual circumstances such as bone marrow transplantation, blood transfusion, or the presence of change(s) in such a small percentage of cells that may not be detectable by the test (mosaicism).",5757,94407046,,,,,,
 ,6100,94407046,,,,,,
This test does not have the ability to detect all of the long-term medical risks that {I/my child} might experience.,6102,94407046,,,,,,
The result of this test does not guarantee my health or the health of my child/fetus.,6220,94407046,,,,,,

"The techniques for freezing eggs, both with the slow freeze method and with vitrification, have become successful enough that they are no longer considered experimental.",5497,38835297,,,,,,
Implantation and pregnancy rates may be lower with frozen eggs than with fresh eggs.,5668,38835297,,,,,,
"Most reports have focused on young women who have responded well to the medications used for egg retrieval, so success rates in older women or poor responders may not be as good.",5754,38835297,,,,,,
Success rates can be expected to vary among clinics.,5934,38835297,,,,,,
"Many good reasons exist for freezing eggs rather than embryos, such as ethical concerns or medical problems that can affect fertility in women without male partners.",5988,38835297,,,,,,
